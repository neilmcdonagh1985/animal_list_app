# animal_list_app

A simple app built with Vue/Javascript. The purpose was to familiarise myself with Vue features such as event listeners/objects and using the document object to add information to the page by manipulating the DOM. I gained experience in accessing the data from the event object and the interactions between Vue, Javascript and HTML. It was also useful to use the developer tools in the console for debugging purposes.
